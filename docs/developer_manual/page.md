The solstice project continuously grows, both in terms of features and size. It gets adopted by more and more subprojects. Thus, we need to take great care with any changes that affect compatibility, performance, scalability, stability, quality and security. For this reason, every new feature or larger enhancement must be properly designed and discussed before it gets accepted into the code base.
